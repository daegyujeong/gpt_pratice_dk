The hallway of Victory Mansions smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. The building has a faulty lift, and the electricity is cut off during daylight hours as part of an economy drive. The flat itself is on the seventh floor, with a poster of Big Brother watching over the residents. Winston\\'s flat in Victory Mansions is small, and he tries to avoid being watched by the telescreen, a surveillance device that is a constant presence.'"
