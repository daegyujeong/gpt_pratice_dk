Details are starting to emerge about a stunning supply chain attack that sent the open source software community reeling. On Friday, a lone Microsoft ... On March 28, 2024 a backdoor was identified in XZ Utils. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-3094 with a CVSS score of 10 is a result of a software supply chain compromise impacting versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recommended organizations to downgrade to a previous non-compromised XZ Utils version. That operation matches the style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison. \"It could very well be someone else,\" says Aitel. The first piece of the backdoor is the m4/build-to-host.m4 file. This file orchestrates minor modifications and conceals the extraction and execution of the Stage 1 backdoor file, bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz. Note how the grep command matches one file in the source directory: Only one file matches given bytes for both versions The version of XZ should be carefully checked, as versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 contain the backdoor. It is advised to revert to a previous known safe version of XZ Utils, such as 5.4.
